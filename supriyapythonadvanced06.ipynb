    "   but receive a text string; or an unexpected I/O error pops up at runtime. What really matters is \"what happens after an \n",
    "   abnormality occurred?\" In other words, \"how the abnormal situations are handled by your program.\" If these exceptions are \n",
    "   not handled properly, the program terminates abruptly and may cause severe consequences. For example, the network \n",
    "   connections, database connections and files may remain opened; database and file records may be left in an inconsistent \n",

    "  Java has a built-in mechanism for handling runtime errors, referred to as exception handling. This is to ensure that you \n",

    "  1. The programmers are not made to aware of the exceptional conditions. For example, the file to be opened may not \n",

    "    force to write the exception handling codes together with the main logic.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "  3. Suppose the programmer decided to write the exception handling codes, the exception handling codes intertwine with the \n",
    "     main logic in many if-else statements. This makes main logic hard to follow and the entire program hard to read. For \n",

    "     \n",
    "  2.You are forced to handle exceptions while writing the main logic and cannot leave them as an afterthought - Your program \n",
    "     cannot compiled without the exception handling codes.\n",
